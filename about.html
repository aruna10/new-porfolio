          <p>Namaste! I am Aruna Gurung, and I am from a beautiful country with the highest peaks in the world, Nepal. Should I include <b>â€˜Budhha was born in Nepalâ€™</b> too? Just Kidding! ðŸ˜…
          </p>
          <p>Yeap thatâ€™s me with lopsided ponytails- prolly 5 or 6 years old. And my life is kinda crazy, as crazy as my ponytails in the photograph! 
          </p>
          <p>I was born and brought up in India, moved to Nepal for my bachelor's, and here I am in Canada for my Postgraduate certification. Too much of moving eh? Well, I am used to moving from place to place; thanks to my dad!           
          </p>

          <p>My dad served the Indian army in the Gorkha Regiment for <b>30 years</b>! He got posted from one place to another every 3-4 years, so with 2-3 duffle bags, 3-4 suitcases, and a truckload of other belongings, our family of 5 would move around India. It continued till I graduated from high school and Dad retired the same year. </p>
          <p>I used to visit Nepal once every 3-4 years during school summer vacations, that too hardly for a month or so. I loved doing that but the Idea of entirely moving to Nepal was daunting and something I was not really sure about. </p>

            <p>But honestly, I am glad I got back to my roots. There were moments I wished I could live but I could not, for instance, more time with my grandparents. </p>
            
            <p>I lived in Nepal for about 7 years before moving to Canada. Itâ€™s been 1.5 years here and it was indeed a hell of a ride! </p>
            
            <p>Talking about my profession, well right now I am a student actively seeking jobs in digital marketing while simultaneously learning data analytics. </p>

          <p>My interest in Computers dates back to 2008 when Dad brought home a desktop computer. We are three siblings in total and I remember three of us had one hour each to do whatever on the computer. </p>
          
          <p>
            I used to paint, type on typing master, use office package tools, explore encyclopedias, and give the last few minutes to my brother with whom Iâ€™d play games like GTA Vice City, Prince of Persia, Mario, etc. He used to be the main player and I, his sidekick. I used to type cheat codes while heâ€™d handle the main control and so forth. 
          </p>
          
          <p>I began side hustle quite earlier Iâ€™d say. I used to tutor my neighboring kids when I was still in school. After coming to Nepal, I tutored my cousins for another 5-6 months before joining my college. And the journey went on and on. You can see my <b>professional journey</b> on the home page itself and if interested to dig deeper then do check out the sections under <b>My Works</b>. </p>
